s required to obtain this n region.  The second additional processing step needed is the ion implantation of the p-type source and drain regions of the PMOS device.  The processes by which the oxide regions the polysilicon gate areas and metallization are accomplished are identical to those for the NMOS enhancement transistor.
As always, the circuit configuration determines the metallization mask.  For example, the inverter shown in Fig. 5-16b requires that connections be formed between D1 and D2, as well
