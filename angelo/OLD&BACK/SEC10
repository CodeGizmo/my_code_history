r the surface where the aluminum is deposited (Fig. 5-7g).  On the other hand, if the n+ diffusion is omitted and the aluminum is deposited directly on the n-type silicon, an equivalent pn structure is formed, resulting in an excellent metal-semiconductor diode.  In Fig. 5-20a contact 1 is a Schottky barrier, whereas contact 2 is an ohmic (nonrectifying) contact, and a Schottky diode exists between these two terminals, as indicated in Fig. 5-20b. 
llector.  Consequently, a junction diode exists between the
