orward volt--ampere characteristics of the three diode types discussed above are shown in Fig. 5-19.  It will be observed that the diode-connected transistor (emitter-base diode wlith collector short-circuited to the base) provides the highest conduction for a given forward voltage.  The reverse recovery time for this diode is also smaller, one-third to one-fourth that of the collector-base diode.

THE METAL-SEMICONDUCTOR CONTACT  Two types of metal-semiconductor junctions are possible, ohmic and rectifyi
