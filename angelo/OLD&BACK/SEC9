ng.  The former is the type of contact desired when a lead is to be attached to a semicondluctor.  On the other hand, the rectifying contact results in a metal-semicondluctor diode called a Schottky barrier.
As mentioned in Sec. 5-1, aluminum acts as a p-type impurity when in contact with silicon.  If aluminum is to be attached as a lead to n-type silicon and an ohmic contact is desired, the formation of a pn juncton must be prevented.  It is for this reason that n+ diffusions are made in the n regions nea
