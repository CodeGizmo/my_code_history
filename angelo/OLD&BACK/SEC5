 emitter and base terminals.  This technique is one of five possible connections.  The three most popular diode configurations are shown in Fig. 5-17.  They are obtained from a BJT structure by using the emitter-base diode, with the collector short-circuited to the base (Fig. 5-17a); the emitter-base diode, with the collector open (Fig. 5-17b); and the collector-base diode, with the emitter open-circuited (or not fabricated at all) (Fig. 5-17c).  The choice of the diode type used depends on the application
