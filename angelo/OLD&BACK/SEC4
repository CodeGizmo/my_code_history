ip area than does the NMOS device.  This is a result of the fact that hole mobility is less than one-half of the electron mobility, and, for both transistors.  The process factor k in Eq. (4-4) is directly proportional to mobility, and for both transistors ot carry the same current, W/L for the PMOS must be larger than that for the NMOS transistor.

MONOLITHIC DIODES   In the current source of Fig. 5-1b, the base of Q1 is short-circuited to the collector.  Consequently, a junction diode exists between the
